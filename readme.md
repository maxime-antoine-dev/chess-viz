## About

![Chess opening visualization](thumbnail.png)

This project focuses on the analytical study of chess openings. See [about.html](about.html) for more details on the project context and problematics.

The project was developed as part of the [Data Visualization](https://lyondataviz.github.io/teaching/lyon1-m2/2025/) course at Claude Bernard University Lyon 1.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Lichess.org](https://database.lichess.org/), a popular online chess platform. It contains detailed records of chess games played on the platform, including information about openings, player ratings, and game outcomes.

## Visualization

The visualizations were created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). They aim to provide insights into the effectiveness of different chess openings and their impact on game results. All visualizations are linked together to allow for interactive exploration of the data.
